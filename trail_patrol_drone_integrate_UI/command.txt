First create a workspace folder in the root and make a symbolic link to the package folder in the git repository.
This way we can build it cleanly seperatly, and we don't build it inside the repositry.

# First, navigate to your ROS workspace src directory
cd ~/trail_patrol_ws_ui/src

# Remove the existing directory if it exists
# Backup first if you have any uncommitted changes
rm -rf trail_patrol_drone_integrate_UI

# Create the symbolic link from your git repo to your workspace
ln -s ~/git/RS1Group31/trail_patrol_drone_integrate_UI .

#Now to make clean build build:

cd ~/trail_patrol_ws_ui
rm -rf build install log
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install

# ===== LAUNCH =====
source install/setup.bash
export MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=4.6
export MESA_GLSL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=460
export MESA_GLSL_CACHE_DISABLE=1
export MESA_NO_ERROR=1
ros2 launch trail_patrol_drone_integrate_UI trail_patrol_drone_mission.launch.py slam:=true nav2:=true rviz:=true

Just need one terminal to run the simulation

# ===== To Start Mission ======

Don't need to put any node in terminal
Use UI:
-Click panel in rviz
-Add New Panels
-in the Panel Type, click Drone Control Panel
-Can be start the mission using the UI 

===How to Use UI=====

In Manual Flight control there is two options:

Autonomus mode(default): 
-Can start the Mission by simply press the start mission , after that all the mission buttoms will work(emergecy, resume and qause)
-the manual drive not avaliable 

Manual mode: 
-Can press all the manual control buttom to control the drone movement
-the mission buttom not gonna work, including qause and resume 
-the emergency stop is still avaliable in manual mode as well 

In Waypoint Manager:

-you can manually type the coordinate x, y ,z
-these custom waypoint will put in mission quece, it will only start after the mission finish  
-there is clear quece buttom to clear the custom waypoint 

In Waypoint Library:

- You can load the waypoint file, choose the waypoint.txtfile so that you can simply just press the waypoint that given
- In this waypoint library, if you press the waypoint, the drone will take that as priority even if it is in the mission
- After arrive to waypoint that you pressed, it will continue the mission.

Should the drone be stuck in a state during mission mode:
- Pause the mission
- Load the waypoint.txt file
- Press the waypoint number that is greater than the progress number you are currently at
- Resume mission
